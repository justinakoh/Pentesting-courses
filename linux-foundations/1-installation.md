# Installation

To set up a Linux machine, the following should be done:
1. Decide what Linux distro you want.
2. Install the image - this can be either a local install, network install, or a live image.
3. Decide whether you want a **native installation**, **virtual machine installation**, or a **live CD/DVB/USB method**.
4. Follow the instructions to set it up.

## Linux Distro Choices
When we talk about Linux, we are only referring to the **operating system kernel**. The kernel is something that is used to communicate bewteen the applications running on the computer, to the hardware physically inside the computer i.e. the CPU, GPU, memory, and any attached devices.

All the interactions carried out between the graphical interface and the hardware is done by the operating system.

This means that when people talk about the 'Linux system', they really should be called the Linux-based system. This is as Linux is not technically the operating system. _The operating system is using a Linux kernel_.

A **linux distribution** on the other hand is to integratie the components that exist above the linux kernel i.e. applications, libraries, graphical environments etc.

The folowing is a list of possible distribution families and the distributions that they have:
- **Red hat**: Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise (REHL), CentOS
- **Debian**: Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint
- **SUSE**: SUSE, OpenSUSE

NOTE:
- The difference between an **operating system** and the **kernel** is that the kernal is _part of_ the operating system. The operating system acts as an interface between the user and the hardware, and the kernel acts as an interface between the applications and the hardware.
